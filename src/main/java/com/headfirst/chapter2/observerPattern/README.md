# Chapter 2: Observer Pattern - Weather Station and Real-World Notification System

## Introduction to the Observer Pattern
The Observer Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that establishes a one-to-many dependency between objects. When the state of one object (the **Subject**) changes, all its dependent objects (the **Observers**) are notified and updated automatically.

### Key Benefits
1. **Loosely Coupled Design**: Subjects and Observers interact minimally, making the system flexible and easier to extend.
2. **Dynamic Behavior**: Observers can be added or removed at runtime without impacting the Subject.

## Package Structure
Here’s how we’ll structure our examples for the Observer Pattern:

```

│   ├── ForecastDisplay.java           # Observer implementation
│   └── WeatherStation.java            # Main simulation
├── notification/            # Real-world example: Notification System
│   ├── Subject.java         # Interface for subjects
│   ├── Observer.java        # Interface for observers

│   ├── EmailObserver.java   # Concrete observer (Email notifications)
│   ├── MobileObserver.java  # Concrete observer (Mobile notifications)
│   └── NotificationSystem.java # Main simulation

## Book Example: Weather Station
In this example, a weather station acts as the Subject, broadcasting weather data to various display Observers.

### Key Classes
1. **Subject Interface**:
    - Maintains a list of Observers.
    - Provides methods to register, remove, and notify Observers.

2. **WeatherData**:
    - Implements the Subject interface.
    - Stores weather data and notifies Observers of changes.

3. **Observer Interface**:
    - Defines an `update()` method that is called when the Subject's state changes.

4. **Display Elements**:
    - Implement the Observer interface to receive weather updates.

## Real-World Example: Notification System
A stock price notification system demonstrates a real-world use case for the Observer Pattern. When a stock's price changes, various notification channels (e.g., email, SMS, mobile app) are updated.

### Key Classes
1. **Subject Interface**:
    - Abstracts the relationship between the stock and its observers.

2. **StockSubject**:
    - Stores stock data (e.g., price, ticker).
    - Notifies all Observers when the price changes.

3. **Observer Interface**:
    - Ensures that all notification channels adhere to a common contract.

4. **Concrete Observers**:
    - **EmailObserver**: Sends email notifications.
    - **MobileObserver**: Sends notifications to a mobile app.

## How to Use This Repository
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tamimdalwai/HeadFirstDesignPatterns
   ```
2. Navigate to the Observer Pattern examples.
3. Run the `WeatherStation` and `NotificationSystem` simulations to see the Observer Pattern in action.

## Design Principles Applied
1. **Strive for Loosely Coupled Designs**:
    - Subjects and Observers are independent, improving flexibility.

2. **Program to Interfaces, Not Implementations**:
    - Both the Subject and Observer interactions are abstracted via interfaces.
