# Design Patterns: A Comprehensive Guide

## üîç SOLID Design Principles: The Foundation of Good Software Design

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
**Definition**: A class should have only one reason to change.
- Each class or module should focus on a single task or responsibility
- Improves maintainability and reduces complexity
- Makes code easier to understand and modify

**Example**:
```java
// Bad: Class with multiple responsibilities
class UserManager {
    void createUser() { /* ... */ }
    void sendEmail() { /* ... */ }
    void generateReport() { /* ... */ }
}

// Good: Separated responsibilities
class UserService {
    void createUser() { /* ... */ }
}
class EmailService {
    void sendEmail() { /* ... */ }
}
class ReportGenerator {
    void generateReport() { /* ... */ }
}
```

### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
**Definition**: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- Design classes that can be extended without modifying existing code
- Use abstractions and interfaces
- Enables adding new functionality with minimal changes

**Example**:
```java
// Extensible design
interface Shape {
    double calculateArea();
}

class Rectangle implements Shape {
    public double calculateArea() { /* ... */ }
}

class Circle implements Shape {
    public double calculateArea() { /* ... */ }
}

// New shapes can be added without modifying existing code
class Triangle implements Shape {
    public double calculateArea() { /* ... */ }
}
```

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
**Definition**: Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program.
- Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes
- Ensure that inherited classes can fulfill the contract of the base class

**Example**:
```java
// Violation of LSP
class Bird {
    void fly() { /* ... */ }
}

class Penguin extends Bird {
    void fly() {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Penguins can't fly");
    }
}

// Better design
interface Flyable {
    void fly();
}

class Bird implements Flyable {
    public void fly() { /* ... */ }
}

class Penguin implements Swimmable {
    public void swim() { /* ... */ }
}
```

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
**Definition**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
- Break large interfaces into smaller, more specific ones
- Avoid "fat" interfaces that force implementing unnecessary methods

**Example**:
```java
// Bloated interface
interface Worker {
    void work();
    void eat();
    void sleep();
}

// Segregated interfaces
interface Workable {
    void work();
}

interface Eatable {
    void eat();
}

interface Sleepable {
    void sleep();
}

class Robot implements Workable {
    public void work() { /* ... */ }
    // No need to implement eat() or sleep()
}
```

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
**Definition**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
- Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations
- Reduces tight coupling between components

**Example**:
```java
// Tight coupling
class EmailService {
    void sendEmail() { /* ... */ }
}

class UserNotifier {
    private EmailService emailService;
    
    void notifyUser() {
        emailService.sendEmail();
    }
}

// Loose coupling with abstraction
interface NotificationService {
    void sendNotification();
}

class EmailService implements NotificationService {
    public void sendNotification() { /* ... */ }
}

class UserNotifier {
    private NotificationService notificationService;
    
    UserNotifier(NotificationService service) {
        this.notificationService = service;
    }
    
    void notifyUser() {
        notificationService.sendNotification();
    }
}
```


## üåü Introduction to Design Patterns

### What are Design Patterns?
Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. They represent best practices evolved over time by experienced software developers. They are like pre-made blueprints that can be customized to solve recurring design problems in code.

### Why Design Patterns Matter
- **Reusability**: Provides tested, proven development paradigms
- **Common Vocabulary**: Creates a standard language for developers
- **Scalability**: Helps in creating more maintainable and flexible software
- **Efficiency**: Reduces complexity and improves code structure

## üèóÔ∏è Design Pattern Classifications

### 1. Creational Patterns
Deals with object creation mechanisms, providing flexible solutions for creating objects.

#### Patterns:
- **Singleton Pattern**
    - Ensures a class has only one instance
    - Provides global point of access to that instance

- **Factory Method Pattern**
    - Defines an interface for creating objects
    - Allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate

- **Abstract Factory Pattern**
    - Creates families of related objects
    - Ensures compatibility between created objects

- **Builder Pattern**
    - Separates complex object construction from its representation
    - Allows step-by-step object creation

- **Prototype Pattern**
    - Creates new objects by cloning existing objects
    - Useful for creating copies with minimal overhead

### 2. Structural Patterns
Explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping them flexible and efficient.

#### Patterns:
- **Adapter Pattern**
    - Allows incompatible interfaces to work together
    - Converts one interface to another expected by clients

- **Decorator Pattern**
    - Adds new behaviors to objects dynamically
    - Provides flexible alternative to subclassing

- **Facade Pattern**
    - Provides simplified interface to complex subsystem
    - Reduces dependencies between multiple components

- **Composite Pattern**
    - Composes objects into tree structures
    - Represents part-whole hierarchies

- **Proxy Pattern**
    - Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object
    - Controls access to the original object

### 3. Behavioral Patterns
Concerned with communication between objects, how objects interact and distribute responsibility.

#### Patterns:
- **Observer Pattern**
    - Defines one-to-many dependency between objects
    - Notifies dependents automatically of any state changes

- **Strategy Pattern**
    - Defines a family of algorithms
    - Makes algorithms interchangeable

- **Command Pattern**
    - Encapsulates a request as an object
    - Allows parameterization of clients with different requests

- **State Pattern**
    - Allows an object to alter its behavior when internal state changes
    - Appears to change its class

- **Template Method Pattern**
    - Defines skeleton of an algorithm
    - Lets subclasses redefine specific steps


## üí° Best Practices
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Program to an interface, not an implementation
- Favor object delegation
- Keep classes loosely coupled
- Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same

## üöÄ Learning Roadmap
1. Understand core design principles
2. Study each pattern's structure and use cases
3. Implement patterns in real-world scenarios
4. Practice and refactor existing code
